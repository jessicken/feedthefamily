# FeedtheFamily
I drew inspiration from various websites I've come across in my life. I am fascinated by those cookie clicker type
games that have a narrative and goal that can be achieved just by clicking on various objects due to the imagination
of the viewer/player and their willingness to ignore the lack of visual narrative. I also like the concept of art as interactive
which I believe is somewhat unique to internet art in that it provides ample opportunity to create not only an environment that
can be accessed almost anywhere, but a collaborative environment that has the potential to be influenced and changed by any person
at any place. I was also inspired by "Can your Pet?" that also creates its art in a faux-game style.
I gave the viewer the opportunity to name the family in this game as an attempt to further the interactiveness as well as increase
the potential accountability that can be felt at the end of the game when the impact of their actions are revealed. This game is also
supposed to be an homage to websites that attempt to teach and create similar traps for viewers who were not expecting a lecture
from the link they clicked, but I made sure the information was as accurate as possible in case someone wished to take it as a learning experience.
I considered adding to this idea by forcing the viewer to name the animals as well as butcher the animals
themselves by dragging them to a butcher block and having resulting exaggerated screaming sounds, but I decided against it as it would
overcomplicate the clicker game format. The ending page has potential for more information to be added and the game in general has lots
of potential additions in content as well as tone depending on how insufferable you would like it to become.
